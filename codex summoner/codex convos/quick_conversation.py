Quick Codex Conversation - Simple command line interface for starting conversations.

This script provides a quick way to start conversations using command line arguments,
similar to the original codex.py format.

Usage examples:
  python quick_conversation.py "Project Name" "Initial prompt"
  python quick_conversation.py "Web App" "Design a modern interface" 3
  python quick_conversation.py "Business Plan" "Create a startup plan" 5 "creative" "analytical"
